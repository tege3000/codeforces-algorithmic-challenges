# Codeforces Algorithmic Challenges

Here, you can find random solutions to algorithmic programming challenges i've solved on Codeforces.

Note:

- File names are the same as the challange names
- Code under "Correct" means that the code passed all the test cases on the platform.
- Code under "Wrong" means that the code might have passed some test cases but not all. Or is still in the works.
